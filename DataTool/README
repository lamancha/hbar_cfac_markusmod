\section sec Introduction
In order to simulate excited (anti-)hydrogen states, we first need to generate a database for the decay rates. This software suite will do exactly that. It will then link to the modified hbar_gshfs simulation and provide deexcitation functionality for the (anti-)hydrogen atoms in this simulation. This software package also contains other misc. tools, such as a web page for visualizing the decay rates.

\section pre Installation
In order to install the software, you first need to obtain it. It is currently housed in a Mercurial repository on the smilx0.smi.oeaw.ac.at server, with repository name hbar_cfac_rikard. After checking out the code, you are ready to install it. 

This software can be installed in two different ways:

1) Full installation. Use this if you need to generate databases with decay rates.

2) Partial installation. Use this if you do NOT need to generate decay rate databases, and only need the installation for running the hbar_gshfs simulation.

There is a setup script, setup.sh, that will guide you through the setup process. In order to successfully install this software, you need to have ROOT installed and configured. If you are going to use the full installation (option 1 above) you also need a fortran77 compiler installed (NOT gfortran). If these prerequisities are fullfilled, the rest should be taken care of by the setup script. The script will basically do the following (interactively):
1) Modify the makefile either to link to the cfac-1.4.1 software or delete these references.
2) Link hbar_gshfs to the software.

Note that in order to use the data generating software with step 1), the installed sfac binary must be accessible from the $PATH variable.

When everything is set up, you can compile the source code for DataTool using the command 'make'.



\section list Components in the software
Some remarks on the different components in this software:

<h3>bingen</h3> Generates binary files containing calculated molecule data using repeated sfac invocation with correct parameters.

<h3>rootgen</h3> Reads binary files generated by bingen, and creates root files with the essential data.

<h3>read</h3> Reads binary files generated by bingen and prints info to stdout (used mainly for integrity validation).

<h3>rootfitmake</h3> Reads a file generated by rootgen and generates a database usable by Geant4.

<h3>Dictionary.so</h3> Shared library for loading some classes into ROOT CINT.

<h3>libG4Dictionary.a</h3> Static libarary for linking with Geant4.

<h3>dumpvalues</h3> Dump values in a file generated by rootfitmake to a text file with SQL INSERT statements that can be used to generate a sql database.

<h3>sql</h3> Directory containing php scripts for generating a SQL database, and a web page to access and visualize the database.

<h3>lib</h3> Directory containing output libraries.

<h3>debug</h3> Directory containing some debug and profiling software, mostly ROOT scripts.

<h3>test</h3> Directory containing unit tests.

\section doc Documentation
The documentation is generated using Doxygen. In order to generate the inheritance diagrams, you need another external tool, Graphviz. Also, the compiled binaries have built-in help, by running them they will display the input options.
